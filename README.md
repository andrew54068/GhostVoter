## How it's Made

**GhostVoter's Creation:** World ID and Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)

GhostVoter is crafted using Worldcoin Anonymous Actions, empowering users with limitless signals while nullifier_hash values fend off sybil attacks and enable choice updates. Custom signals efficiently cluster unique choices within an action, preserving anonymity yet facilitating user and vote tracking.
